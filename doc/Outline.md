# Is Writing a Game a Good Way to Learn Math?

- Writing a demo or a small game can be a great way to learn
  some of the mathematics behind today's video games.
- For any serious game development it's probably best to use
  one of the existing game engines like Unity or Unreal
  which offer incredible performance.
- Using an engine or a framework often means
  that some of the really interesting math
  has been done for you
  and while that may be practical,
  it's still worthwhile to take a close look
  at some of the underlying principles and their history.
- I will show some of the things that I've learned about
  from years of dabbling.
- These algorithms look simple and yield impressive results,
  but they are also easy to get wrong.
- This helps us to appreciate the remarkable efforts
  of the mathematicians and computer scientists
  who first discovered them.

Here is the motivation for the examples:

- Generate "random" points on a fictitious planet
  based on an initial "seed", such that
  every player with that value sees
  the same random-looking pattern.
- Control the rotation of a orbiting satellite...
