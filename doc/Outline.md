# Is Writing a Game a Good Way to Learn Math?

- Writing a demo or a small game can be a great way to learn some of the mathematics
  behind today's video games.
- I will share some of the things that I learned
  during my (unsuccessful) attempts to write a game.
- I will show how these relatively simple-looking equations
  which have become commonplace
  actually represent remarkable efforts
  by the mathematicians and computer scientists who discovered them.
- To provide motivation, here are some examples:
  - Generate "random" points on a fictitious planet
    based on an initial "seed", such that
    every player with that value sees
    the same random-looking pattern.
  - Control the rotation of a orbiting satellite...
